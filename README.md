#Hello World
**Here is a story, why I choose to be a part of IT**
***It was rainy September day, and I was sitting in a warm living room and drinking a 
couple of hot coffee and scrolling Instagram. Story after story and my eyes suddenly stopped 
on a story with #Acodemy page hashtag. I taped on the link and started to explore the page. 
It is interesting, because previously we were talking with my friends about possibility of 
working in IT sphere, and they were asking me why I don't want to try it. Moment later I dropped 
message to find out more information about this course - Quality Assurance Engineer. It was really 
important to me - to understand how deep is that course, because my knowledge of IT is equivalent a zero. 
I received the answer from Acodemy shortly, and I decided to give it a chance.***

**5 reasons why I start a course:**

* Opportunity to learn absolutely something new
* Most of my friends are working in IT sphere
* We are spending all our lives in the WEB, and I wanted to find out about it from inside 
* If I become a good specialist, I will earn a lot of money 
* If you work in IT, you can work remotely

*So, let's talk about each reason a little bit more*

**Opportunity to learn absolutely something new**

***Why I decided to study such an important thing as Information Technologies? 
Because education is like food - you need it every day, and if you didn't have a food you will starve, 
and at one day you will die. New information improves your skills, you become an interesting person, 
you grow up in your morals, and you will improve your knowledge.***
